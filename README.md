# SQL Analysis
This repository contains a collection of analytical work using SQL in the pgAdmin platform, as part of the CareerFoundry course.

Using SQL, I was tasked to establish and present data-driven recommendations for a brick-and-morter video rental company called Rockbuster in order to bring them into the online streaming sector. Some information they requested were average rental duration for the films, countries in which the Rockbuster customer base are located in, customers with the highest lifetime expenditure with the company, and whether sales differed between geographical locations.
