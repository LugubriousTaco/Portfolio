# SQL Analysis
This repository contains a collection of analytical work using SQL in the pgAdmin platform, as part of the CareerFoundry course.

## Objective
Using SQL, I was tasked to establish and present recommendations for a fictional brick-and-morter video rental company called Rockbuster in order to bring them into the online streaming sector. Using a large dataset provided by the company, it was my job to organize, analyze, and create data-driven insights on the customer base in order for Rockbuster to effectively transition their business model.

## Data
The data used in this project covered the following:
- Payment
- Actor
- Genre
- Store location
- Rental information
- Inventory
- Customer information
- Staff
- Language of the films
- Addressess of customers

## Tools
The SQL code was written and executed using PostgreSQL in the pgAdmin4 app.

## Additional Resources
Along with the scripts used, I have included a data dictionary of the dataset, as well as the presentation of the recommendations for Rockbuster.
