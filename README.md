This repository contains a collection of analytical work using SQL in the pgAdmin platform, and Python in Jupyter notebooks.

Using SQL, I was tasked to establish and present data-driven recommendations for a brick-and-morter video rental company called Rockbuster in order to bring them into the online streaming sector. Some information they requested were average rental duration for the films, countries in which the Rockbuster customer base are located in, customers with the highest lifetime expenditure with the company, and whether sales differed between geographical locations.

Using Python, Instacart requested I look into the demographics and sales of their customer base in order to more accurately target their marketing strategies. The first priority was to create flag variables to identify particular groups of people and sales windows, including high order volume times, loyalty level of each customer, and an overarching demographic flag which took into account age, income, and number of dependents. Using these indicators, I was then asked to find any trends in ordering behaviors within different groups of customers and report to them using an Excel spreadsheet.
